# qrefine
Quantum Refinement Project

### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qrefine/qr-core.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qrefine/qr-core)

Quantum refinement is an attempt to apply quantum chemistry to better refine bio-macromolecules.

An <i>ideal</i> solution is to have a tightly integrated QM code capable of delivering accurate energies and gradients.

Currently, in the development phase of the project, we are using the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), see https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/
